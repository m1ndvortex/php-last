# Security and Authentication Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical security and authentication issues in the jewelry platform. The system currently has minimal security features implemented but suffers from authentication bypass, session management instability, and unreliable login processes that compromise the application's security posture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Authentication System Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want a reliable login system that works consistently without errors, so that I can access the application without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters valid credentials THEN the system SHALL authenticate successfully on the first attempt
2. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear, actionable error messages
3. WHEN network errors occur during login THEN the system SHALL retry automatically with exponential backoff
4. WHEN the login process encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL maintain the session reliably without unexpected logouts

### Requirement 2: Route Protection and Access Control

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all protected routes to require authentication, so that unauthorized users cannot access sensitive application areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected routes THEN the system SHALL redirect them to the login page
2. WHEN a user accesses a protected route directly via URL THEN the system SHALL verify authentication before allowing access
3. WHEN an authenticated user's session expires THEN the system SHALL redirect them to login and preserve their intended destination
4. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the system SHALL redirect them to their originally requested page
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update route access permissions immediately

### Requirement 3: Session Management Stability

**User Story:** As a user, I want stable session management that doesn't log me out unexpectedly during work, so that I can complete tasks without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user is actively using the application THEN the system SHALL extend the session automatically
2. WHEN a user is inactive for the configured timeout period THEN the system SHALL log them out gracefully
3. WHEN session timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL show a clear warning before logout
4. WHEN the frontend and backend session timers conflict THEN the system SHALL synchronize them properly
5. WHEN a user performs actions THEN the system SHALL reset the session timeout consistently

### Requirement 4: Frontend Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to properly implement security measures, so that client-side security complements server-side protection.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API requests THEN the frontend SHALL include proper authentication headers
2. WHEN CSRF tokens are required THEN the frontend SHALL obtain and send them correctly
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the frontend SHALL handle token refresh automatically
4. WHEN the user logs out THEN the frontend SHALL clear all authentication data completely
5. WHEN security headers are missing THEN the frontend SHALL handle the errors gracefully

### Requirement 5: Backend Security Enforcement

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want the backend to enforce authentication on all protected endpoints, so that API access is properly secured.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints are accessed without authentication THEN the system SHALL return 401 Unauthorized
2. WHEN invalid tokens are presented THEN the system SHALL reject the request with appropriate error codes
3. WHEN session middleware detects expired sessions THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session properly
4. WHEN security violations occur THEN the system SHALL log them with sufficient detail for investigation
5. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update all relevant security contexts

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Security Testing

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests that verify all security features work correctly, so that security regressions can be detected early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN security tests run THEN they SHALL verify authentication flows work correctly
2. WHEN testing route protection THEN tests SHALL confirm unauthorized access is blocked
3. WHEN testing session management THEN tests SHALL verify timeout behavior works properly
4. WHEN testing frontend security THEN tests SHALL confirm proper token handling
5. WHEN testing API security THEN tests SHALL verify all endpoints are properly protected
6. WHEN security features change THEN automated tests SHALL detect any regressions

### Requirement 7: Security Documentation and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer or system administrator, I want clear documentation about the security system, so that I can understand, maintain, and configure it properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing new features THEN developers SHALL have clear security guidelines to follow
2. WHEN configuring the system THEN administrators SHALL have documented configuration options
3. WHEN troubleshooting security issues THEN clear diagnostic procedures SHALL be available
4. WHEN security settings need adjustment THEN the impact and requirements SHALL be documented
5. WHEN onboarding new team members THEN security architecture SHALL be clearly explained
