# Login and Dashboard Performance Fixes Requirements

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for fixing critical performance and functionality issues in the jewelry platform's login and dashboard systems. The application currently suffers from extremely slow page load times (over 5 seconds), unreliable authentication, non-functional notification bells, and broken quick actions. These issues severely impact user experience and productivity in the Docker-based environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Login Page Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want the login page to load quickly (under 2 seconds) so that I can access the application without delays.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing http://localhost:3000/login THEN the page SHALL load completely within 2 seconds
2. WHEN accessing http://localhost/login THEN the page SHALL load completely within 2 seconds  
3. WHEN the login page loads THEN all assets SHALL be optimized and compressed
4. WHEN the login form renders THEN it SHALL be immediately interactive without loading delays
5. WHEN network requests are made THEN they SHALL be optimized to minimize round trips
6. WHEN Docker containers are running THEN login page performance SHALL remain consistent
7. WHEN multiple users access login simultaneously THEN performance SHALL not degrade

### Requirement 2: Authentication Reliability and Speed

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want login authentication to work instantly and reliably so that I can access the dashboard without frustration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I enter valid credentials (test@example.com/password) THEN authentication SHALL complete within 1 second
2. WHEN authentication succeeds THEN I SHALL be redirected to dashboard immediately without delays
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN I SHALL receive clear error messages within 1 second
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL retry authentication automatically
5. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN proper loading indicators SHALL be displayed
6. WHEN session expires THEN re-authentication SHALL work seamlessly
7. WHEN using Docker environment THEN authentication SHALL work consistently across container restarts

### Requirement 3: Dashboard Loading Performance

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want the dashboard to load quickly with real data so that I can immediately see my business metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard loads THEN initial view SHALL appear within 2 seconds
2. WHEN dashboard data loads THEN KPIs SHALL display real business data from the database
3. WHEN charts render THEN they SHALL use actual sales and inventory data
4. WHEN widgets load THEN they SHALL show current business metrics
5. WHEN dashboard refreshes THEN updates SHALL complete within 1 second
6. WHEN multiple dashboard components load THEN they SHALL load in parallel for optimal performance
7. WHEN dashboard is accessed repeatedly THEN appropriate caching SHALL improve load times

### Requirement 4: Functional Notification System

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want working notification bells that show real alerts so that I can stay informed about important business events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN notifications exist THEN notification bell icons SHALL display accurate badge counts
2. WHEN I click notification bells THEN they SHALL open functional alert modals
3. WHEN alerts are generated THEN they SHALL appear in real-time without page refresh
4. WHEN I interact with notifications THEN I SHALL be able to mark them as read
5. WHEN I dismiss notifications THEN they SHALL be removed from the display
6. WHEN new alerts arrive THEN notification badges SHALL update automatically
7. WHEN notification actions exist THEN clicking them SHALL navigate to relevant pages

### Requirement 5: Working Quick Actions

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want functional quick action buttons so that I can quickly navigate to important features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click quick action buttons THEN they SHALL navigate to the correct pages immediately
2. WHEN quick actions have badges THEN they SHALL display accurate counts
3. WHEN quick actions are disabled THEN they SHALL show appropriate visual feedback
4. WHEN I hover over quick actions THEN they SHALL provide clear visual feedback
5. WHEN quick actions load THEN they SHALL be immediately clickable
6. WHEN quick action routes exist THEN navigation SHALL work without errors
7. WHEN quick actions have permissions THEN they SHALL respect user access levels

### Requirement 6: Real Data Integration

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want the dashboard to display actual business data instead of mock data so that I can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dashboard loads THEN all KPIs SHALL display real data from the database
2. WHEN sales charts render THEN they SHALL show actual sales transactions
3. WHEN inventory widgets display THEN they SHALL show current stock levels
4. WHEN financial metrics appear THEN they SHALL reflect actual business performance
5. WHEN alerts are shown THEN they SHALL be based on real business conditions
6. WHEN recent activities display THEN they SHALL show actual user actions
7. WHEN data updates THEN changes SHALL be reflected across all dashboard components

### Requirement 7: Docker Environment Optimization

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want the application to perform well in the Docker environment so that deployment and scaling work effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker containers start THEN application SHALL be ready within 30 seconds
2. WHEN containers restart THEN performance SHALL remain consistent
3. WHEN multiple containers run THEN resource usage SHALL be optimized
4. WHEN database connections are made THEN they SHALL be pooled efficiently
5. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be cached appropriately
6. WHEN API calls are made THEN they SHALL use optimized connection handling
7. WHEN memory usage grows THEN it SHALL be managed to prevent container issues

### Requirement 8: Performance Monitoring and Diagnostics

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want performance monitoring tools so that I can identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance issues occur THEN detailed logging SHALL be available
2. WHEN page load times exceed thresholds THEN alerts SHALL be generated
3. WHEN API response times are slow THEN specific endpoints SHALL be identified
4. WHEN database queries are slow THEN query performance SHALL be logged
5. WHEN memory usage is high THEN resource consumption SHALL be tracked
6. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with sufficient context for debugging
7. WHEN performance metrics are collected THEN they SHALL be accessible for analysis

### Requirement 9: Caching and Asset Optimization

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want optimized assets and caching so that the application loads quickly on subsequent visits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be compressed and cached
2. WHEN API responses are cacheable THEN they SHALL be cached appropriately
3. WHEN images are loaded THEN they SHALL be optimized for web delivery
4. WHEN JavaScript bundles are served THEN they SHALL be minified and split appropriately
5. WHEN CSS is loaded THEN it SHALL be optimized and cached
6. WHEN browser caching is used THEN cache headers SHALL be set correctly
7. WHEN cache invalidation is needed THEN it SHALL work reliably

### Requirement 10: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a jewelry business user, I want robust error handling so that temporary issues don't prevent me from using the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN network errors occur THEN the system SHALL retry requests automatically
2. WHEN API endpoints are temporarily unavailable THEN graceful fallbacks SHALL be provided
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN clear error messages SHALL guide user actions
4. WHEN dashboard components fail to load THEN error states SHALL be displayed clearly
5. WHEN performance degrades THEN the system SHALL continue to function with reduced features
6. WHEN errors are recoverable THEN automatic recovery SHALL be attempted
7. WHEN critical errors occur THEN users SHALL be provided with actionable next steps
