# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical user experience issues with the current authentication system and tab navigation performance. Users are experiencing repeated authentication prompts when switching between tabs, slow tab loading times, and non-functional logout functionality. The solution will implement seamless tab navigation with persistent authentication, optimized loading performance, and reliable logout functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between tabs without being prompted to authenticate every time, so that I can work efficiently without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user successfully authenticates THEN the authentication state SHALL persist across all application tabs
2. WHEN a user switches between tabs THEN the system SHALL NOT display authentication prompts if already authenticated
3. WHEN a user opens a new tab of the application THEN the system SHALL recognize existing authentication from other tabs
4. IF a user's session is valid THEN tab switching SHALL be instantaneous without authentication delays
5. WHEN authentication expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication only once across all tabs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want tabs to load quickly when I switch between them, so that I can navigate the application efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user switches to a previously loaded tab THEN the tab SHALL load within 100ms
2. WHEN a user switches tabs THEN the system SHALL use cached data where appropriate to improve loading speed
3. WHEN a tab is loading THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading indicators
4. IF network connectivity is slow THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical UI elements for faster perceived loading
5. WHEN switching between tabs THEN the system SHALL preload commonly accessed data

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the logout button to work reliably, so that I can securely end my session when needed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the logout button THEN the system SHALL immediately clear all authentication tokens
2. WHEN logout is initiated THEN the system SHALL invalidate the session across all open tabs
3. WHEN logout completes THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page
4. IF logout fails THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message and retry mechanism
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN all cached sensitive data SHALL be cleared from the browser

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all authentication improvements to work seamlessly in the Docker environment, so that development and production environments remain consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication features are implemented THEN they SHALL function correctly in Docker containers
2. WHEN running Docker commands THEN all authentication tests SHALL pass in the containerized environment
3. WHEN deploying to Docker THEN session management SHALL work across container restarts
4. IF Docker containers are restarted THEN user sessions SHALL be properly restored where appropriate
5. WHEN testing in Docker THEN all authentication flows SHALL be validated against real web application instances

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive tests that validate authentication functionality with real web application interactions, so that I can ensure the system works reliably in production scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are created THEN they SHALL test against the real web application rather than mocks
2. WHEN tests encounter issues THEN the system SHALL prioritize fixing code to match test expectations rather than modifying tests
3. WHEN Playwright MCP tests are implemented THEN they SHALL validate complete user authentication workflows
4. IF tests fail THEN the implementation SHALL be corrected to ensure test success
5. WHEN authentication tests run THEN they SHALL cover tab switching, session persistence, and logout functionality
6. WHEN performance tests execute THEN they SHALL validate tab loading times meet the 100ms requirement
7. WHEN integration tests run THEN they SHALL use the test credentials: test@example.com with password "password"
