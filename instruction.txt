Bilingual Persian/English Jewelry Business Platform (پلتفرم طلافروشی دوزبانه – لاراول + ویو)
1. Project Overview

Vision:
Develop an advanced, bilingual (Persian & English) jewelry business management web application using Laravel (PHP) and Vue.js. The platform will be tailored for a single jeweler (طلافروش) with enterprise-grade capabilities across invoicing, inventory, CRM, and accounting. It will feature a seamless RTL/LTR interface, remain simple to self-host, and be fully customizable.

Key Goals:

✅ Single-user, single-database structure — no SaaS complexity.

✅ Bilingual Interface: Full support for both Persian (RTL) and English (LTR), with easy toggling between languages.

✅ Full localization for Persian (Jalali calendar, فارسی اعداد) and standard formatting for English.

✅ Self-hostable: Works on shared hosting, VPS, or Docker.

✅ Deep, modular feature set in each tab (accounting, CRM, invoicing, etc.).

✅ Full custom invoice template designer (طراحی فاکتور دلخواه).

✅ Optional user roles for internal staff (e.g., حسابدار / Accountant).
